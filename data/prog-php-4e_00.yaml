- en: It’s hard to believe that nearly 20 years ago I picked up my first PHP book.
    I had an interest in programming, extending beyond Netscape Composer and static
    HTML. I knew PHP would enable me to create dynamic, smarter websites—and to store
    and fetch data to create interactive web applications.

  zh: 很难相信将近20年前，我第一次拿起了我的第一本PHP书。我对编程有兴趣，超越了Netscape Composer和静态HTML。我知道PHP能让我创建动态、更智能的网站，并且存储和获取数据以创建交互式的Web应用程序。
- en: What I didn’t know was the journey that unlocking these new capabilities with
    PHP would take me on, or how PHP would evolve 20 years later to become the programming
    language powering roughly 80% of the web, and backed by one of the nicest, friendliest,
    and most engaging communities.

  zh: 我不知道的是，解锁PHP的这些新能力将带我走向何方，或者PHP将如何在20年后演变成为支配大约80%的Web的编程语言，并得到一个友善、友好和充满活力的社区的支持。
- en: A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. By selecting *Programming
    PHP* by Peter MacIntyre and Kevin Tatroe, you have taken that first step not only
    into PHP and its basics, but also into the future of website and web application
    development. With the available tools and a firm understanding of the PHP programming
    language, the only limitation will be your imagination and your willingness to
    continue to grow and immerse yourself in the community. The journey is yours,
    the possibilities endless, and the future for you to define.

  zh: 千里之行始于足下。通过选择Peter MacIntyre和Kevin Tatroe的*Programming PHP*，你不仅迈出了进入PHP及其基础的第一步，还迈出了进入网站和Web应用程序开发未来的一步。凭借可用的工具和对PHP编程语言的深入理解，唯一的限制将是你的想象力和继续成长并沉浸在社区中的意愿。这段旅程属于你，可能性无限，未来由你定义。
- en: As you get ready to begin this journey, I would like to share a couple tidbits
    of advice. First, take each chapter and put it into practice, try different things,
    and don’t be afraid of breaking something or failing. While *Programming PHP*
    will establish a strong foundation, it’s up to you to explore the language and
    find new and creative ways to pull together all of these components.

  zh: 当你准备开始这段旅程时，我想分享几条建议。首先，把每一章节实践，尝试不同的方法，不要害怕出错或失败。虽然*Programming PHP*会为你奠定坚实的基础，但探索语言并找到汇集所有这些组成部分的新创意方式，仍由你来决定。
- en: 'My second piece of advice: be an active part of the PHP community. Take advantage
    of online communities, user groups, and PHP conferences as you are able. As you
    try new things, share them with the community for their feedback and advice.'

  zh: 我的第二条建议是：成为PHP社区的积极一员。尽可能利用在线社区、用户组和PHP会议。当你尝试新事物时，与社区分享并获取他们的反馈和建议。
- en: Not only are you sure to find a community of support—a group of some of the
    nicest people, who want you to succeed and are more than happy to take their time
    to help you through your journey—but you’ll also establish a baseline of continuous
    learning, helping you grasp the core skills of PHP more quickly and keeping you
    up to date on new programming theories, technologies, tools, and changes. Not
    to mention, you’ll encounter an onslaught of terrible puns (including from yours
    truly).

  zh: 不仅可以找到一个支持的社群——一群最友善的人，他们希望你成功，并乐意花时间帮助你在编程旅程中取得进展——而且你还将建立一个持续学习的基础，帮助你更快掌握PHP的核心技能，并保持对新的编程理论、技术、工具和变化的了解。更不用说，你将会遭遇一连串的糟糕双关语（包括我自己的）。
- en: With that, I would like to be among the first to welcome you and to wish you
    the very best on your journey—a journey that couldn’t start off better than with
    this book!
