&#13;
&#13;
<p>As Laravel has grown, the Laravel team has built a suite of tools to support and simplify the lives and workflows of Laravel developers. Much of the new work has gone straight into the core, but there are quite a few packages and SaaS offerings that aren’t part of the core but are still very much a part of the Laravel experience.<a data-primary="files" data-see="also storage and retrieval" data-type="indexterm" id="id1983"/><a data-primary="MVC" data-see="Model-View-Controller applications" data-type="indexterm" id="id1984"/><a data-primary="REST" data-see="representational state transfer" data-type="indexterm" id="id1985"/><a data-primary="templates/templating" data-see="Blade templating; mail" data-type="indexterm" id="id1986"/><a data-primary="inheritance" data-see="under Blade templating" data-type="indexterm" id="id1987"/><a data-primary="Laravel Blade" data-see="Blade templating" data-type="indexterm" id="id1988"/><a data-primary="migrations" data-see="under databases" data-type="indexterm" id="id1989"/><a data-primary="starter kits" data-see="under frontend components" data-type="indexterm" id="id1990"/><a data-primary="Vite configuration" data-see="under frontend components" data-type="indexterm" id="id1991"/><a data-primary="SPA" data-see="single-page application" data-type="indexterm" id="id1992"/><a data-primary="interfaces" data-see="also APIs; fluent interfaces" data-type="indexterm" id="id1993"/><a data-primary="spies" data-see="mocking" data-type="indexterm" id="id1994"/><a data-primary="mail" data-see="also notification" data-type="indexterm" id="id1995"/><a data-primary="notifications" data-see="also mail" data-type="indexterm" id="id1996"/><a data-primary="messages" data-see="also mail" data-type="indexterm" id="id1997"/><a data-primary="redirects" data-see="routing and controllers" data-type="indexterm" id="id1998"/></p>&#13;

<h1>Tools Not Covered in This Book</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>These<a data-primary="Laravel" data-secondary="tools not discussed" data-type="indexterm" id="Lnotdis17"/> are a few tools that I did not cover because they are beyond the scope of this book. Some of these are just for use in special circumstances (Cashier for taking payments, Socialite for social login, etc.), but some I use every day (Forge, especially).</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Here’s a brief introduction, beginning with the ones you’re most likely to encounter in your work. Note that this list is not exhaustive!</p>&#13;

<h2>Forge</h2>&#13;

It provisions Laravel-ready servers (and individual sites on those servers) with all the tools you need to run them, from queues and queue workers to Let’s Encrypt SSL certificates. It can also set up simple shell scripts to autodeploy your sites when you push up new code to GitHub or Bitbucket.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Forge is incredibly useful for spinning up sites quickly and easily, but it’s not so minimal that you can’t also run your apps on it in the longer term or at larger scale. You can scale up your server sizes, add load balancers, and manage private networking between your servers, all within Forge.</p>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Envoyer" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="id355">&#13;
<h2>Envoyer</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a href="https://envoyer.io">Envoyer</a> is<a data-primary="Envoyer" data-type="indexterm" id="id2012"/> a paid SaaS tool that’s branded as offering “zero downtime PHP deployment.” Unlike Forge, Envoyer doesn’t spin up your servers or manage them. Its primary job is to listen to triggers—​usually when you push new code, but you can also manually trigger deployments or trigger them with webhooks—​and perform your deployment steps in response.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>There are three ways that Envoyer does this much better than Forge’s push-to-deploy tool and most other push-to-deploy solutions:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>It has a robust toolset for building out your deployment pipeline as a simple but powerful multistage process.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>It deploys your app using Capistrano-style zero-downtime deploys; each new deployment is built into its own folder, and only once the build process has completed successfully is that deploy folder symlinked to your actual web root. Because of this, there’s no moment when your server is broken while Composer installs or NPM builds.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Because of this folder-based system, it’s easy and quick to roll back any breaking changes to a previous release; Envoyer just updates the symlink back to a previous deploy folder and it’s immediately serving an older build.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
&#13;
<p>You can also set up regular health checks (pings against your servers that report errors to you if the pings don’t get back a 200 HTTP response), expectations that your cron jobs will ping Envoyer on a regular schedule, and chat-based notifications of any significant events.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Envoyer is more of a niche tool than Forge. I don’t know many Laravel developers who don’t use Forge, but those who pay for Envoyer are more likely to have websites that will suffer if they can’t immediately roll back a problematic commit, or websites that get enough traffic (or important enough traffic) that 10 seconds of downtime here and there can be a big issue. If your site is in that category, Envoyer will feel like magic.</p>&#13;

If you imagine your average complex Laravel app, it may have several parts: the public-facing website or customer view, the administration section for making changes to the core data or customer list, and maybe an API.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Nova drastically simplifies the process of building the admin panel part of the site using Vue and a Laravel API. It makes it easy to generate CRUD (create, read, update, delete) pages for all of your resources, together with more complex custom views for your data, custom actions and relationships on each of your resources, and even custom tools for adding non-CRUD tooling to the same general admin space.</p>&#13;

<h2>Folio</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Folio<a data-primary="Folio" data-type="indexterm" id="id2022"/> is a Laravel package that allows you to build your app’s routing based on the arrangement of template files inside of folders. Similar to Next and Nuxt, Folio allows you to create individual templates (e.g., <em>/index.blade.php</em> displays at <code>mysite.com/</code>, &#13;
<span class="keep-together"><em>/about.blade.php</em></span> at <code>mysite.com/about</code>, and <em>/users/index.blade.php</em> at <code>mysite.com/users</code>) or define templates that should match placeholders in the URL (e.g. <em>/users/[id].blade.php</em> at <code>mysite.com/users/14</code>).</p>&#13;

&#13;
<p>Volt<a data-primary="Volt" data-type="indexterm" id="id2023"/> augments Livewire with the ability to write single-file, functional components. Volt also offers a directive, <code>@volt</code>, that allows you to assign a subsection of a template to be managed by the Livewire component definition, while the rest of the template is still normal Blade.</p>&#13;

<p>There<a data-primary="resources for learning" data-secondary="blogs" data-type="indexterm" id="id2028"/> are many blogs (I have one at <a class="orm:hideurl" href="https://mattstauffer.com/"><em>mattstauffer.com</em></a> and Tighten has one at <a class="orm:hideurl" href="https://www.tighten.com"><em>tighten.com</em></a>, and there are plenty of others that are incredibly useful), many excellent Twitter-ers, many superb package authors, and far too many Laravel practitioners who I respect to fit into a list here. This is a rich, diverse, and giving community, full of developers who love to share everything they’re learning; the hard part is not finding good content but finding the time to consume it all.<a data-primary="application programming interfaces" data-see="APIs" data-type="indexterm" id="id2029"/><a data-primary="authorization code grants" data-see="also authentication and authorization" data-type="indexterm" id="id2030"/><a data-primary="broadcasting events" data-see="under events" data-type="indexterm" id="id2031"/><a data-primary="controller authorization" data-see="also routing and controllers" data-type="indexterm" id="id2032"/><a data-primary="data" data-see="also storage and retrieval; user-provided data" data-type="indexterm" id="id2033"/><a data-primary="databases" data-see="also Eloquent; storage and retrieval" data-type="indexterm" id="id2034"/><a data-primary="dependency injection" data-see="also containers" data-type="indexterm" id="id2035"/><a data-primary="dummies" data-see="mocking" data-type="indexterm" id="id2036"/><a data-primary="Eloquent" data-see="also databases; storage and retrieval" data-type="indexterm" id="id2037"/><a data-primary="email verification" data-see="also mail" data-type="indexterm" id="id2038"/></p>&#13;

<p>I can’t list every person or resource you should look to in your journey as a Laravel developer, but if you start with the resources and folks listed here, you will be off to a great start in getting up and running with Laravel.</p>&#13;
