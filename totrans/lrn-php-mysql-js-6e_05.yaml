    server, you will have to upload every modification you make to a server somewhere
    else on the web before you can test it.

    slowdown in development time. On a local computer, however, testing can be as
    easy as saving an update (usually just a matter of clicking once on an icon) and
    then hitting the Refresh button in your browser.

    embarrassing errors or security problems while you’re writing and testing, whereas
    you need to be aware of what people may see or do with your application when it’s
    on a public website. It’s best to iron everything out while you’re still on a
    home or small office system, presumably protected by firewalls and other safeguards.

    in [Chapter 1](ch01.xhtml#introduction_to_dynamic_web_content). But to test the
    results of your work—particularly when we start using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML5
    later in this book—you should ideally have an instance of every major web browser
    running on some system convenient to you. Whenever possible, the list of browsers
    should include at least Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Safari, and Google
    Chrome. You may need all these once you have a product ready to release, just
    to ensure everything runs as expected on all browsers and platforms. If you plan
    to ensure that your sites look good on mobile devices too, you should try to arrange
    access to a wide range of iOS and Android devices.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: WAMP, MAMP, and LAMP are abbreviations for “Windows, Apache, MySQL, and PHP,”
    “Mac, Apache, MySQL, and PHP,” and “Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP.” These abbreviations
    each describe a fully functioning setup used for developing dynamic internet web
    pages.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: WAMPs, MAMPs, and LAMPs come in the form of packages that bind the bundled programs
    together so that you don’t have to install and set them up separately. This means
    you can simply download and install a single program and follow a few easy prompts
    to get your web development server up and running fast, with minimal hassle.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: During installation, several default settings are created for you. The security
    configurations of such an installation will not be as tight as on a production
    web server, because it is optimized for local use. For these reasons, you should
    never install such a setup as a production server.

    (such as an http:// file from an https:// web page). It is likely that other browsers
    will follow this security initiative too. Currently the AMPPS website uses mixed

    when Chrome (or another browser) prompts that *“AMPPS can’t be downloaded securely”*
    and to use the up selection arrow to select the option *Keep*, and your download
    will resume. Additionally, if clicking the download link appears to do nothing,
    you will have to right-click it and select *Save As* to initiate the download.

    Often the means of file transfer you use will be down to the policies of the company

    Everyone has different programming styles and preferences, though, so if you don’t
    get on with it, there are plenty more code editors available to choose from—or
    you may wish to go directly for an integrated development environment (IDE), as
    described in the following section.

    the syntax appropriately, using colors to help clarify what’s going on. What’s
    more, you can place the cursor next to brackets or braces, and it will highlight
    the matching ones so that you can check whether you have too many or too few.
    In fact, VSC does a lot more in addition, which you will discover and enjoy as
    you use it. You can download a copy from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com).

    their utility pales when compared to integrated development environments. IDEs
    offer many additional features such as in-editor debugging and program testing,
    as well as function descriptions and much more, although these are features that
    are slowly creeping into some code editors too these days, such as the previously
    recommended VSC. [Figure 2-13](#when-youre-using-an-ide) shows the popular Eclipse
    IDE with some HTML loaded into the main frame (it allows you to work with PHP,
    JavaScript, and other file types as well).

    of your code, which will stop at the breakpoints and provide you with information
    about the program’s current state.

    advise you to download a couple or more to try them out first; they all either
    have trial versions or are free to use, so it won’t cost you anything.

    where we’ll start exploring PHP in further depth and find out how to get HTML
    and PHP to work together, as well as how the PHP language itself is structured.
    But before moving on, I suggest you test your new knowledge with the following
    questions.
