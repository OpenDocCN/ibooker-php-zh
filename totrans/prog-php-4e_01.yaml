- en: Now more than ever, the web is a major vehicle for corporate and personal communications.
    Websites carry satellite images of Earth in its entirety; search for life in outer
    space; house personal photo albums, business shopping carts, and product lists;
    and so much more! Many of those websites are driven by PHP, an open source scripting
    language primarily designed for generating HTML content.

- en: Since its inception in 1994, PHP has swept the web and continues its phenomenal
    growth today. The millions of websites powered by PHP are testament to its popularity
    and ease of use. Everyday people can learn PHP and build powerful dynamic websites
    with it.

- en: The core PHP language (version 7+) features powerful string- and array-handling
    facilities, as well as greatly improved support for object-oriented programming.
    With the use of standard and optional extension modules, a PHP application can
    interact with a database such as MySQL or Oracle, draw graphs, create PDF files,
    and parse XML files. You can run PHP on Windows, which lets you control other
    Windows applications (such as Word and Excel with COM) or interact with databases
    using ODBC.

    you how it ends!), you will know how the PHP language works, how to use the many
    powerful extensions that come standard with PHP, and how to design and build your
    own PHP web applications.

- en: PHP is a melting pot of cultures. Web designers appreciate its accessibility
    and convenience, while programmers appreciate its flexibility, power, diversity,
    and speed. Both cultures need a clear and accurate reference to the language.
    If you are a (web) programmer, then this book is for you. We show the big picture
    of the PHP language, and then discuss the details without wasting your time. The
    many examples clarify the textual explanations; the practical programming advice
    and many style tips will help you become not just a PHP programmer, but a *good*
    PHP programmer.

    specific technologies, such as JSON, XML, sessions, PDF generation, and graphics.
    And you’ll be able to quickly get the information you need from the language chapters,
    which explain basic programming concepts in simple terms.
