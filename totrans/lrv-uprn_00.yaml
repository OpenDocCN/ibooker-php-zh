- en: 'The story of how I got started with Laravel is a common one: I had written
    PHP for years, but I was on my way out the door, pursuing the power of Rails and
    other modern web frameworks. Rails in particular had a lively community, a perfect
    combination of opinionated defaults and flexibility, and the power of Ruby-Gems
    to leverage prepackaged common code.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Something kept me from jumping ship, and I was glad for that when I found Laravel.
    It offered everything I was drawn to in Rails, but it wasn’t just a Rails clone;
    this was an innovative framework with incredible documentation, a welcoming community,
    and clear influences from many languages and frameworks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since that day I’ve been able to share my journey of learning Laravel through
    blogging, podcasting, and speaking at conferences; I’ve written dozens of apps
    in Laravel for work and side projects; and I’ve met thousands of Laravel developers
    online and in person. I have plenty of tools in my development toolkit, but I
    am honestly happiest when I sit down in front of a command line and type `laravel
    new *projectName*`.

- en: What This Book Is About
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is not the first book about Laravel, and it won’t be the last. I don’t
    intend for this to be a book that covers every line of code or every implementation
    pattern. I don’t want this to be the sort of book that goes out of date when a
    new version of Laravel is released. Instead, its primary purpose is to provide
    developers with a high-level overview and concrete examples to learn what they
    need to work in any Laravel codebase with any and every Laravel feature and subsystem.
    Rather than mirroring the docs, I want to help you understand the foundational
    concepts behind Laravel.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Laravel is a powerful and flexible PHP framework. It has a thriving community
    and a wide ecosystem of tools, and as a result, it’s growing in appeal and reach.
    This book is for developers who already know how to make websites and applications
    and want to learn how to do so well in Laravel.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Laravel’s documentation is thorough and excellent. If you find that I don’t
    cover any particular topic deeply enough for your liking, I encourage you to visit
    the [online documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and dig deeper into that
    particular topic.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I think you will find the book a comfortable balance between high-level introduction
    and concrete application, and by the end you should feel comfortable writing an
    entire application in Laravel from scratch. And, if I did my job well, you’ll
    be excited to try.

- en: Who This Book Is For
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book assumes knowledge of basic object-oriented programming practices,
    PHP (or at least the general syntax of C-family languages), and the basic concepts
    of the Model–View–Controller (MVC) pattern and templating. If you’ve never made
    a website before, you may find yourself in over your head. But as long as you
    have some programming experience, you don’t have to know anything about Laravel
    before you read this book—we’ll cover everything you need to know, from the simplest
    “Hello, world!”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Laravel can run on any operating system, but there will be some bash (shell)
    commands in the book that are easiest to run on Linux/macOS. Windows users may
    have a harder time with these commands and with modern PHP development, but if
    you follow the instructions to get Homestead (a Linux virtual machine) running,
    you’ll be able to run all of the commands from there.

- en: How This Book Is Structured
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'This book is structured in what I imagine to be a chronological order: if you’re
    building your first web app with Laravel, the early chapters cover the foundational
    components you’ll need to get started, and the later chapters cover less foundational
    or more esoteric features.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Each section of the book can be read on its own, but for someone new to the
    framework, I’ve tried to structure the chapters so that it’s actually very reasonable
    to start from the beginning and read until the end.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Where applicable, each chapter will end with two sections: “Testing” and “TL;DR.”
    If you’re not familiar, “TL;DR” means “too long; didn’t read.” These final sections
    will show you how to write tests for the features covered in each chapter and
    will give a high-level overview of what was covered.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The first edition of *Laravel: Up & Running* came out in December 2016 and
    covered Laravel versions 5.1 to 5.3\. The second edition came out in April 2019
    and added coverage for 5.4 to 5.8 and Laravel Dusk and Horizon, and added an 18th
    chapter about community resources and other noncore Laravel packages that weren’t
    covered in the first 17 chapters. This third edition catches the book up to Laravel
    10 and adds Breeze, Jetstream, Fortify, Vite, and much more.'

    how hard he’s worked to have empathy for developers and to build a positive and
    encouraging community. But I also want to thank him for being a kind, encouraging,
