<p class="author1">Even on a fast broadband connection, this can still represent a significant slowdown in development time. On a local computer, however, testing can be as easy as saving an update (usually just a matter of clicking once on an icon) and then hitting the Refresh button in your browser.</p>

<p class="author1">Another advantage of a development server is that you don’t have to worry about embarrassing errors or security problems while you’re writing and testing, whereas you need to be aware of what people may see or do with your application when it’s on a public website. It’s best to iron everything out while you’re still on a home or small office system, presumably protected by firewalls and other safeguards.</p>

<p class="author1">Once you have your own development server, you’ll wonder how you ever managed without one, and it’s easy to set one up. Just follow the steps in the following sections, using the appropriate instructions for a PC, a Mac, or a Linux system.</p>

<p class="author1">In<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="development server setup" data-secondary="recommended browsers" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45694758088936" class="calibre6"/> this chapter, we cover just the server side of the web experience, as described in <a data-type="xref" href="ch01.xhtml#introduction_to_dynamic_web_content" class="calibre6">Chapter 1</a>. But to test the results of your work—particularly when we start using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML5 later in this book—you should ideally have an instance of every major web browser running on some system convenient to you. Whenever possible, the list of browsers should include at least Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Safari, and Google Chrome. You may need all these once you have a product ready to release, just to ensure everything runs as expected on all browsers and platforms. If you plan to ensure that your sites look good on mobile devices too, you should try to arrange access to a wide range of iOS and Android devices.</p>

<p class="author1">WAMPs, MAMPs, and LAMPs come in the form of packages that bind the bundled programs together so that you don’t have to install and set them up separately.

The security configurations of such an installation will not be as tight as on a production web server, because it is optimized for local use. For these reasons, you should never install such a setup as a production server.</p>

<p class="author1">However, for developing and testing websites and applications, one of these installations should be entirely sufficient.</p>

<p class="author1">If you choose not to go the WAMP/MAMP/LAMP route for <span class="keep-together">building</span> your own development system, you should know that downloading and integrating the various parts yourself can be very time-consuming and may require a lot of research in order to configure everything fully. But if you already have all the components installed and integrated with one another, they should work with the examples in this book.</p>

<p class="author1">There<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="development server setup" data-secondary="AMPPS installation on Windows" data-type="indexterm" id="DSSampps02" class="calibre6"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AMPPS server" data-secondary="Windows installation" data-type="indexterm" id="AMwindow02" class="calibre6"/> are several available WAMP servers, each offering slightly different configurations. Of the various open source and free options, one of the best is AMPPS. You can download it by clicking the button on the website’s <a href="http://ampps.com" class="calibre6">home page</a>, shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#ampps-website" class="calibre6">Figure 2-1</a>. (There are also Mac and Linux versions available; see <a data-type="xref" href="#installing_xampp_on_mac_os_x" class="calibre6">“Installing AMPPS on macOS”</a> and <a data-type="xref" href="#installing_a_lamp_on_linux" class="calibre6">“Installing a LAMP on Linux”</a>.)</p>

It is likely that other browsers will follow this security initiative too. Currently the AMPPS website uses mixed sources, and you may encounter this issue. The answer is to not select <em class="hyperlink">DISCARD</em> when Chrome (or another browser) prompts that <em class="hyperlink">“AMPPS can’t be downloaded securely”</em> and to use the up selection arrow to select the option <em class="hyperlink">Keep</em>, and your download will resume. Additionally, if clicking the download link appears to do nothing, you will have to right-click it and select <em class="hyperlink">Save As</em> to initiate the download.</p>
</div>

<p class="author1">I recommend that you always download the latest stable release (as I write this, it’s 3.9, which is about 114 MB in size). The various Windows, macOS, and Linux installers are listed on the download page.</p>

</div>

<p class="author1">Once you’ve downloaded the installer, run it to bring up the window shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#the-opening-window-of" class="calibre6">Figure 2-2</a>.

<p class="author1">Click Next, after which you must accept the agreement. Click Next once again, and then once more to move past the information screen. You will now need to confirm the installation location.

<p class="author1">The first thing to do at this point is verify that everything is working correctly. To do this, enter either of the following two URLs into the address bar of your browser:</p>

<pre data-programming-language="perl" class="calibre29">
localhost
127.0.0.1</pre>

<p class="author1">This will call up an introductory screen, where you will have the opportunity to secure AMPPS by giving it a password (see <a data-type="xref" href="#the-initial-security" class="calibre6">Figure 2-7</a>). I recommend you don’t check the box and just click the Submit button to proceed without setting a password.</p>

<p class="author1">Once this has been done you will be taken to the main control page at <em class="hyperlink">localhost/ampps/</em> (from now on I will assume you are accessing AMPPS through <em class="hyperlink">localhost</em> rather than <em class="hyperlink">127.0.0.1</em>). From here you can configure and control all aspects of the AMPPS stack, so make a note of this for future reference, or perhaps set a bookmark in your browser.</p>

<p class="author1">Next, type the following to view the document root (described in the following section) of your new Apache web server:</p>

The former will ensure access to PHP, MySQL, and all the features of a web server, while the latter will simply load the file into the browser, which will do its best to display it but will be unable to process any PHP or other server instructions. So, you should generally run examples using the <em class="hyperlink">localhost</em> preface from your browser’s address bar, unless you are certain that the file doesn’t rely on web server functionality.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="DSSmac02" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45694757897272" class="calibre6"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="AMmac02" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45694757559464" class="calibre6"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="Mampps02" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45694757558088" class="calibre6"/></p>

However, there are dozens of popular flavors of Linux, and each of them may require installing a LAMP in a slightly different way, so I can’t cover them all in this book. However, there is a version of AMPPS available for Linux, which is probably the simplest way for you to go.</p>

<p class="author1">That said, some Linux versions come preinstalled with a web server and MySQL, and the chances are that you may already be all set to go. To find out, try entering the following into a browser and see whether you get a default document root web page:</p>

<pre data-programming-language="perl" class="calibre29">
localhost</pre>

<p class="author1">If this works, you probably have the Apache server installed and may well have MySQL up and running too; check with your system administrator to be sure.</p>

<p class="author1">If you don’t yet have a web server installed, however, there’s a version of AMPPS available that you can download from the website.</p>

<p class="author1">Installation is similar to the sequence shown in the preceding section. If you need further assistance on using the software, please refer to the documentation.</p>

You should use the secure SSH protocol to log in to your server to manually create databases and set permissions from the command line. Your web hosting company will advise you on how best to do this and provide you with any password it has set for your MySQL access (as well as, of course, for getting into the server in the first place). I recommend you never use the insecure Telnet protocol to remotely log in to any server.</p>

<p class="author1">On a Mac, you already have SSH available. Just select the <em class="hyperlink">Applications</em> folder, followed by <em class="hyperlink">Utilities</em>, and then launch Terminal. In the Terminal window, log in to a server using SSH as follows:</p>

Although FTP is not a secure protocol, software that helps you upload and download files is still often referred to as FTP, but it’s FTPS or SFTP that you need to ensure proper security on your web server. If you go searching the web for a good client, you’ll find so many that it could take you quite a while to come across one with all the right features for you.</p>

There are far safer methods than FTP for transferring files, such as using Git or similar technologies. Also, SSH-based SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) and SCP (Secure Copy Protocol) are gaining traction. Good FTP programs, however, will also support SFTP and FTPS (FTP-SSL). Often the means of file transfer you use will be down to the policies of the company you work for, but for personal use an FTP program such as FileZilla (discussed next) will provide most (if not all) of the functionality and security you require.</p>

Today’s program editors are smart and can show you where you have syntax errors before you even run a program. Once you’ve used a modern editor, you’ll wonder how you ever managed without one.</p>

<p class="author1">There<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Visual Studio Code (VSC)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45694757499784" class="calibre6"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Microsoft Visual Studio Code (VSC)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45694757498680" class="calibre6"/> are a number of good programs available, but I have settled on Visual Studio Code (VSC) from Microsoft because it’s powerful; runs on all of Windows, Mac, and Linux; and is free (see <a data-type="xref" href="#program-editors-like-visual" class="calibre6">Figure 2-12</a>). Everyone has different programming styles and preferences, though, so if you don’t get on with it, there are plenty more code editors available to choose from—or you may wish to go directly for an integrated development environment (IDE), as described in the following section.</p>

<figure class="calibre23"><div id="program-editors-like-visual" class="figure"><img alt="" class="iimagesvscpng" src="Images/pmj6_0212.png"/>
<h6 class="calibre24"><span class="keep-together">Figure 2-12. </span>Program editors (like Visual Studio Code) are superior to plain-text <span class="keep-together">editors</span></h6>
</div></figure>

<p class="author1">As you can see from <a data-type="xref" href="#program-editors-like-visual" class="calibre6">Figure 2-12</a>, VSC highlights the syntax appropriately, using colors to help clarify what’s going on. What’s more, you can place the cursor next to brackets or braces, and it will highlight the matching ones so that you can check whether you have too many or too few. In fact, VSC does a lot more in addition, which you will discover and enjoy as you use it. You can download a copy from <a class="calibre6" href="https://code.visualstudio.com">code.visualstudio.com</a>.</p>

<p class="author1">Again, if you have a different preferred program editor, use that; it’s always a good idea to use programs you’re already familiar with.</p>
