Logging accesses to your pages in your own private log files\n. Real-time viewing of log information\n. Providing a nice interface to this log information\n. Displaying last access information right on your pages\n. Full daily and total access counters\n. Banning access to users based on their domain\n. Password protecting pages based on users' domains\n. Tracking accesses ** based on users' e-mail addresses **\n. Tracking referring URL's - HTTP_REFERER support\n. Performing server-side includes without needing server support for it\n. Ability to not log accesses from certain domains (ie. your own)\n. Easily create and display forms\n. Ability to use form information in following documents\n\nHere is what you don't need to use these tools:\n\n. You do not need root access - install in your ~/public_html dir\n. You do not need server-side includes enabled in your server\n. You do not need access to Perl or Tcl or any other script interpreter\n. You do not need access to the httpd log files\n\nThe only requirement for these tools to work is that you have\nthe ability to execute your own cgi programs. Ask your system\nadministrator if you are not sure what this means.\n\nThe tools also allow you to implement a guestbook or any other\nform that needs to write information and display it to users\nlater in about 2 minutes.\n\nThe tools are in the public domain distributed under the GNU\nPublic License. Yes, that means they are free!\n\nFor a complete demonstration of these tools, point your browser\nat: http://www.io.org/~rasmus\n\n--\nRasmus Lerdorf\nrasmus@io.org\nhttp://www.io.org/~rasmus\n```", "```php\n From: rasmus@madhaus.utcs.utoronto.ca (Rasmus Lerdorf)\n Subject: ANNOUNCE: PHP/FI Server-side HTML-Embedded Scripting Language\n Date: 1996/04/16\n Newsgroups: comp.infosystems.www.authoring.cgi\n\n PHP/FI is a server-side HTML embedded scripting language. It has built-in\n access logging and access restriction features and also support for\n embedded SQL queries to mSQL and/or Postgres95 backend databases.\n\n It is most likely the fastest and simplest tool available for creating\n database-enabled web sites.\n\n It will work with any UNIX-based web server on every UNIX flavour out\n there. The package is completely free of charge for all uses including\n commercial.\n\n Feature List:\n\n . Access Logging\n Log every hit to your pages in either a dbm or an mSQL database.\n Having hit information in a database format makes later analysis easier.\n . Access Restriction\n Password protect your pages, or restrict access based on the refering URL\n plus many other options.\n . mSQL Support\n Embed mSQL queries right in your HTML source files\n . Postgres95 Support\n Embed Postgres95 queries right in your HTML source files\n . DBM Support\n DB, DBM, NDBM and GDBM are all supported\n . RFC-1867 File Upload Support\n Create file upload forms\n . Variables, Arrays, Associative Arrays\n . User-Defined Functions with static variables + recursion\n . Conditionals and While loops\n Writing conditional dynamic web pages could not be easier than with\n the PHP/FI conditionals and looping support\n . Extended Regular Expressions\n Powerful string manipulation support through full regexp support\n . Raw HTTP Header Control\n Lets you send customized HTTP headers to the browser for advanced\n features such as cookies.\n . Dynamic GIF Image Creation\n Thomas Boutell's GD library is supported through an easy-to-use set of\n tags.\n\n It can be downloaded from the File Archive at: <URL:http://www.vex.net/php>\n\n --\n Rasmus Lerdorf\n rasmus@vex.net\n```", "```php\n June 6, 1998 -- The PHP Development Team announced the release of PHP 3.0,\n the latest release of the server-side scripting solution already in use on\n over 70,000 World Wide Web sites.\n\n This all-new version of the popular scripting language includes support\n for all major operating systems (Windows 95/NT, most versions of Unix,\n and Macintosh) and web servers (including Apache, Netscape servers,\n WebSite Pro, and Microsoft Internet Information Server).\n\n PHP 3.0 also supports a wide range of databases, including Oracle,\n Sybase, Solid, MySQ, mSQL, and PostgreSQL, as well as ODBC data sources.\n\n New features include persistent database connections, support for the\n SNMP and IMAP protocols, and a revamped C API for extending the language\n with new features.\n\n \"PHP is a very programmer-friendly scripting language suitable for\n people with little or no programming experience as well as the\n seasoned web developer who needs to get things done quickly. The\n best thing about PHP is that you get results quickly,\" said\n Rasmus Lerdorf, one of the developers of the language.\n\n \"Version 3 provides a much more powerful, reliable, and efficient\n implementation of the language, while maintaining the ease of use and\n rapid development that were the key to PHP's success in the past,\"\n added Andi Gutmans, one of the implementors of the new language core.\n\n \"At Circle Net we have found PHP to be the most robust platform for\n rapid web-based application development available today,\" said Troy\n Cobb, Chief Technology Officer at Circle Net, Inc. \"Our use of PHP\n has cut our development time in half, and more than doubled our client\n satisfaction. PHP has enabled us to provide database-driven dynamic\n solutions which perform at phenomenal speeds.\"\n\n PHP 3.0 is available for free download in source form and binaries for\n several platforms at http://www.php.net/.\n\n The PHP Development Team is an international group of programmers who\n lead the open development of PHP and related projects.\n\n For more information, the PHP Development Team can be contacted at\n core@php.net.\n```", "```php\n<html>\n <head>\n <title>Look Out World</title>\n </head>\n\n <body>\n <?php echo \"Hello, world!\"; ?>\n </body>\n</html>\n```", "```php\n<?php phpinfo();?>\n```", "```php\n<html>\n <head>\n <title>Personalized Greeting Form</title>\n </head>\n\n <body>\n <?php if(!empty($_POST['name'])) {\n echo \"Greetings, {$_POST['name']}, and welcome.\";\n } ?>\n\n <form action=\"<?php echo $_SERVER['PHP_SELF']; ?>\" method=\"post\">\n Enter your name: <input type=\"text\" name=\"name\" />\n <input type=\"submit\" />\n </form>\n </body>\n</html>\n```", "```php\n<?php\n\n$db = new mysqli(\"localhost\", \"petermac\", \"password\", \"library\");\n\n// make sure the above credentials are correct for your environment\nif ($db->connect_error) {\n die(\"Connect Error ({$db->connect_errno}) {$db->connect_error}\");\n}\n\n$sql = \"SELECT * FROM books WHERE available = 1 ORDER BY title\";\n$result = $db->query($sql);\n\n?>\n<html>\n<body>\n\n<table cellSpacing=\"2\" cellPadding=\"6\" align=\"center\" border=\"1\">\n <tr>\n <td colspan=\"4\">\n <h3 align=\"center\">These Books are currently available</h3>\n </td>\n </tr>\n\n <tr>\n <td align=\"center\">Title</td>\n <td align=\"center\">Year Published</td>\n <td align=\"center\">ISBN</td>\n </tr>\n <?php while ($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) { ?>\n <tr>\n <td><?php echo stripslashes($row['title']); ?></td>\n <td align=\"center\"><?php echo $row['pub_year']; ?></td>\n <td><?php echo $row['ISBN']; ?></td>\n </tr>\n <?php } ?>\n</table>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```", "```php\n<?php\nif (isset($_GET['message'])) {\n // load font and image, calculate width of text\n $font = dirname(__FILE__) .
