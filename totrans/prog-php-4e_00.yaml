- en: It’s hard to believe that nearly 20 years ago I picked up my first PHP book.
    I had an interest in programming, extending beyond Netscape Composer and static
    HTML. I knew PHP would enable me to create dynamic, smarter websites—and to store
    and fetch data to create interactive web applications.

- en: What I didn’t know was the journey that unlocking these new capabilities with
    PHP would take me on, or how PHP would evolve 20 years later to become the programming
    language powering roughly 80% of the web, and backed by one of the nicest, friendliest,
    and most engaging communities.

- en: A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. By selecting *Programming
    PHP* by Peter MacIntyre and Kevin Tatroe, you have taken that first step not only
    into PHP and its basics, but also into the future of website and web application
    development. With the available tools and a firm understanding of the PHP programming
    language, the only limitation will be your imagination and your willingness to
    continue to grow and immerse yourself in the community. The journey is yours,
    the possibilities endless, and the future for you to define.

- en: As you get ready to begin this journey, I would like to share a couple tidbits
    of advice. First, take each chapter and put it into practice, try different things,
    and don’t be afraid of breaking something or failing. While *Programming PHP*
    will establish a strong foundation, it’s up to you to explore the language and
    find new and creative ways to pull together all of these components.

    of online communities, user groups, and PHP conferences as you are able. As you
    try new things, share them with the community for their feedback and advice.'

- en: Not only are you sure to find a community of support—a group of some of the
    nicest people, who want you to succeed and are more than happy to take their time
    to help you through your journey—but you’ll also establish a baseline of continuous
    learning, helping you grasp the core skills of PHP more quickly and keeping you
    up to date on new programming theories, technologies, tools, and changes. Not
    to mention, you’ll encounter an onslaught of terrible puns (including from yours
    truly).

    the very best on your journey—a journey that couldn’t start off better than with
    this book!
