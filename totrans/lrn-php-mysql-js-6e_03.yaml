- en: The combination of PHP and MySQL is the most convenient approach to dynamic,
    database-driven web design, holding its own in the face of challenges from some
    other integrated frameworks that are harder to learn. Due to its open source roots,
    it is free to implement and is therefore an extremely popular option for web development.

- en: Any would-be developer on a Unix/Linux or even a Windows platform will need
    to master these technologies. And, combined with the partner technologies of JavaScript,
    React, CSS, and HTML5, you will be able to create websites of the caliber of industry
    standards like Facebook, Twitter, and Gmail.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for people who wish to learn how to create effective and dynamic
    websites. This may include webmasters or graphic designers who have already mastered
    creating static websites, or a CMS such as WordPress, but wish to take their skills
    to the next level, as well as high school and college students, recent graduates,
    and self-taught individuals.

    will obtain a thorough grounding in the core technologies of PHP, MySQL, JavaScript,
    CSS, and HTML5, and you’ll learn the basics of the React library, too.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book assumes that you have a basic understanding of HTML and can at least
    put together a simple, static website but does not assume that you have any prior
    knowledge of PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, CSS, or HTML5—although if you do, your progress
    through the book will be even quicker.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The chapters in this book are written in a specific order, first introducing
    all of the core technologies it covers and then walking you through their installation
    on a web development server so that you will be ready to work through the examples.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the first section, you will gain a grounding in the PHP programming language,
    covering the basics of syntax, arrays, functions, and object-oriented programming.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then, with PHP under your belt, you will move on to an introduction to the MySQL
    database system, where you will learn everything from how MySQL databases are
    structured to how to generate complex queries.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After that, you will learn how you can combine PHP and MySQL to start creating
    your own dynamic web pages by integrating forms and other HTML features. You will
    then get down to the nitty-gritty practical aspects of PHP and MySQL development
    by learning a variety of useful functions and how to manage cookies and sessions,
    as well as how to maintain a high level of security.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the next few chapters, you will gain a thorough grounding in JavaScript,
    from simple functions and event handling to accessing the Document Object Model,
    in-browser validation, and error handling. You’ll also get a comprehensive primer
    on using the popular React library for JavaScript.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With an understanding of all three of these core technologies, you will then
    learn how to make behind-the-scenes Ajax calls and turn your websites into highly
    dynamic environments.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next, you’ll spend two chapters learning all about using CSS to style and lay
    out your web pages, before discovering how the React libraries can make your development
    job a great deal easier. You’ll then move on to the final section on the interactive
    features built into HTML5, including geolocation, audio, video, and the canvas.
    After this, you’ll put together everything you’ve learned in a complete set of
    programs that together constitute a fully functional social networking website.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Along the way, you’ll find plenty of advice on good programming practices and
    tips that can help you find and solve hard-to-detect programming errors. There
    are also plenty of links to websites containing further details on the topics
    covered.
