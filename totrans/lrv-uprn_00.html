<h1>Preface</h1>&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
<p>The story of how I got started with Laravel is a common one: I had written PHP for years, but I was on my way out the door, pursuing the power of Rails and other modern web frameworks. Rails in particular had a lively community, a perfect combination of opinionated defaults and flexibility, and the power of Ruby-Gems to leverage prepackaged common code.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Something kept me from jumping ship, and I was glad for that when I found Laravel. It offered everything I was drawn to in Rails, but it wasn’t just a Rails clone; this was an innovative framework with incredible documentation, a welcoming community, and clear influences from many languages and frameworks.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Since that day I’ve been able to share my journey of learning Laravel through blogging, podcasting, and speaking at conferences; I’ve written dozens of apps in Laravel for work and side projects; and I’ve met thousands of Laravel developers online and in person. I have plenty of tools in my development toolkit, but I am honestly happiest when I sit down in front of a command line and type <code>laravel new <em>projectName</em></code>.</p>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="What This Book Is About" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="id367">&#13;
<h1>What This Book Is About</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This is not the first book about Laravel, and it won’t be the last. I don’t intend for this to be a book that covers every line of code or every implementation pattern. I don’t want this to be the sort of book that goes out of date when a new version of Laravel is released. Instead, its primary purpose is to provide developers with a high-level overview and concrete examples to learn what they need to work in any Laravel codebase with any and every Laravel feature and subsystem. Rather than mirroring the docs, I want to help you understand the foundational concepts behind Laravel.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Laravel is a powerful and flexible PHP framework. It has a thriving community and a wide ecosystem of tools, and as a result, it’s growing in appeal and reach. This book is for developers who already know how to make websites and applications and want to learn how to do so well in Laravel.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Laravel’s documentation<a data-primary="Laravel" data-secondary="documentation" data-type="indexterm" id="id739"/> is thorough and excellent. If you find that I don’t cover any particular topic deeply enough for your liking, I encourage you to visit the <a href="https://laravel.com/docs">online documentation</a> and dig deeper into that particular topic.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>I think you will find the book a comfortable balance between high-level introduction and concrete application, and by the end you should feel comfortable writing an entire application in Laravel from scratch. And, if I did my job well, you’ll be excited to try.</p>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Who This Book Is For" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="id1">&#13;
<h1>Who This Book Is For</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This<a data-primary="Laravel" data-secondary="prerequisites to learning" data-type="indexterm" id="id740"/> book assumes knowledge of basic object-oriented programming practices, PHP (or at least the general syntax of C-family languages), and the basic concepts of the Model–View–Controller (MVC) pattern and templating. If you’ve never made a <span class="keep-together">website</span> before, you may find yourself in over your head. But as long as you have some programming experience, you don’t have to know anything about Laravel before you read this book—we’ll cover everything you need to know, from the simplest “Hello, world!”</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Laravel<a data-primary="Laravel" data-secondary="operating system" data-type="indexterm" id="id741"/><a data-primary="operating system" data-type="indexterm" id="id742"/> can run on any operating system, but there will be some bash (shell) commands in the book that are easiest to run on Linux/macOS. Windows users may have a harder time with these commands and with modern PHP development, but if you follow the instructions to get Homestead (a Linux virtual machine) running, you’ll be able to run all of the commands from there.</p>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="How This Book Is Structured" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="id368">&#13;
<h1>How This Book Is Structured</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This book is structured in what I imagine to be a chronological order: if you’re building your first web app with Laravel, the early chapters cover the foundational components you’ll need to get started, and the later chapters cover less foundational or more esoteric features.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Each section of the book can be read on its own, but for someone new to the framework, I’ve tried to structure the chapters so that it’s actually very reasonable to start from the beginning and read until the end.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Where applicable, each chapter will end with two sections: “Testing” and “TL;DR.” If you’re not familiar, “TL;DR” means “too long; didn’t read.” These final sections will show you how to write tests for the features covered in each chapter and will give a high-level overview of what was covered.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The<a data-primary="Laravel" data-secondary="version discussed" data-type="indexterm" id="id743"/> book is written for Laravel 10.</p>&#13;

<h1>About the Third Edition</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The first edition of <em>Laravel: Up &amp; Running</em> came out in December 2016 and covered Laravel versions 5.1 to 5.3. The second edition came out in April 2019 and added coverage for 5.4 to 5.8 and Laravel Dusk and Horizon, and added an 18th chapter about community resources and other noncore Laravel packages that weren’t covered in the first 17 chapters. This third edition catches the book up to Laravel 10 and adds Breeze, Jetstream, Fortify, Vite, and much more.</p>&#13;

<h1>Acknowledgements</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>I’ve received so much support from so many people during this project, I don’t even know where to begin.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>My partner, Imani, has celebrated every win, encouraged the hell out of me, and sat next to me with her laptop open, typing furiously, as we both push to make our deadlines. My son, Malachi, and daughter, Mia, have been so incredibly gracious and understanding throughout all of this. My entire team at Tighten has been supportive and encouraging since day one. My friends Trent and Tevin have worked hard to create spaces for art and artists, and I’m so grateful to be a part of their little family.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>I’ve had a series of research assistants: Wilbur Powery, Brittany Jones Dumas, Reeka Maharaj, and Ana Lisboa. There’s no way I could’ve written the second and third editions with my current busy life without their help.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>There are so many people in the Laravel community who deserve thanks at this point that I couldn’t even begin to include them all. So, to every one of you who’s put in so much love, devotion, care, craft…​thank you. Thank you for the ways you’ve helped this community be an incredible place; thank you for so many of you who’ve reached out to encourage me through parenting, divorce, pandemic, depression, and whatever else. Y’all are amazing.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Taylor Otwell deserves thanks and honor for creating Laravel—​and therefore creating so many jobs and helping so many developers love our lives that much more. He deserves appreciation for how he’s focused on developer happiness and how hard he’s worked to have empathy for developers and to build a positive and encouraging community. But I also want to thank him for being a kind, encouraging, and challenging friend. Taylor, you’re a boss.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Thanks to all my my technical reviewers! For the 1e: Keith Damiani, Michael Dyrynda, Adam Fairholm, and Myles Hyson. For the 2e: Tate Peñaranda, Andy Swick, Mohamed Said, and Samantha Geitz. For the 3e: Anthony Clark, Ben Holmen, Jake Bathman, and Tony Messias.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>And, of course, thanks to the rest of my family and friends, who supported me directly or indirectly through this process—​my parents and siblings, my communities in Chicago and Gainesville and Decatur and Atlanta, other business owners and authors, other conference speakers, other parents, and just an incredible number of wonderful humans I’m grateful to have met and interacted with.</p>&#13;
