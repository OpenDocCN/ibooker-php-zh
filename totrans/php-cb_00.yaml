- en: Nearly every developer who builds modern web applications has an opinion on
    PHP. Some love the language. Some loathe the language. Most are familiar with
    its impact and applications written in the language. This is because PHP powers
    over 75% of websites for which the language in which they are written is known.
    Given the sprawling size of the internet, that’s a *lot* of PHP code in the wild.^([1](preface01.html#idm45875192190240))

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Admittedly, not all PHP code is good code. Anyone who has written PHP code has
    seen the good, the bad, and the ugly presented by the language. It’s a remarkable
    easy language to work with, which is cause for both the sheer power behind its
    market dominance and for the missteps made by many engineers writing questionable
    code.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unlike fully compiled languages that enforce strict typing and memory management,
    PHP is an interpreted language that is incredibly forgiving of programming mistakes.
    In many cases, even a grievous programming error will result in a warning while
    PHP continues to happily execute the program regardless. This is great for developers
    learning a new language, as an innocent error won’t necessarily crash the application.
    But this forgiving nature is a double-edged sword of sorts. As even “bad code”
    will run, many developers publish that code, which is then easily reused by unsuspecting
    beginners.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book aims to defend against the reuse of bad code by helping you understand
    how to avoid mistakes made by those who came before. It also aims to establish
    patterns and examples any developer can follow to solve common problems with PHP.
    The recipes in this book will help you quickly identify and solve complicated
    problems without needing to reinvent the wheel, or ever be tempted to copy and
    paste “bad code” discovered through additional research.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for any engineer who has ever built or maintained a web application
    or website built in PHP. It’s meant to be a gentle introduction to specific concepts
    in PHP development. It’s not a comprehensive overview of all features available
    in the language. Ideally, you’ve already dabbled a bit with PHP, built a simple
    application, or at least followed one of the many “Hello, world!” examples littering
    the internet.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you’re not familiar with PHP but know another programming language well,
    this book will serve as a helpful way to transition your skills over to a new
    stack. The *PHP Cookbook* illustrates how to accomplish specific tasks in PHP.
    Please compare each block of example code with the way you would solve the same
    problem in your strongest language; this will help drive home the differences
    between that language and PHP itself.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I don’t expect anyone to read this book in one sitting. Instead, the contents
    are intended to serve as a frequent reference while you build out or architect
    a new application. Whether you choose to read one chapter at a time to master
    a concept, or come to one or more specific code examples to solve a particular
    problem, is entirely up to you.
  prefs: []

- en: Each recipe is self-contained and contains a fully realized code solution you
    can leverage in your day-to-day work to solve similar problems. Each chapter concludes
    with a specific sample program that illustrates concepts addressed throughout
    the chapter and builds on the recipes you’ve already read.

- en: 'The book starts by covering the basic building blocks of any language: variables,
    operators, and functions. [Chapter 1](ch01.html#chapter_variables) introduces
    variables and basic data handling. [Chapter 2](ch02.html#chapter_operators) expands
    on this foundation by walking through the various operators and operations supported
    natively by PHP. [Chapter 3](ch03.html#chapter_functions) brings both concepts
    together by establishing higher-level functions and creating basic programs.'

- en: The next five chapters introduce PHP’s typing system. [Chapter 4](ch04.html#chapter_strings)
    covers everything you ever wanted to know—and some things you didn’t know you
    didn’t know—about string handling in PHP. [Chapter 5](ch05.html#chapter_numbers)
    explains both integer and floating-point (decimal) arithmetic and introduces further
    building blocks needed for complex functionality. [Chapter 6](ch06.html#chapter_datetime)
    covers PHP’s handling of dates, times, and datetimes. [Chapter 7](ch07.html#chapter_arrays)
    introduces and explains every way developers might want to group data into lists.
    Finally, [Chapter 8](ch08.html#chapter_classes) explains how developers can *extend*
    PHP’s primitive types by introducing their own classes and higher-level objects.

    discusses PHP’s encryption and security functionality to help build out truly
    secure, modern applications. [Chapter 10](ch10.html#chapter_file_handling) introduces
    PHP’s file handling and manipulation functionality. As files are fundamentally
    built on streams, that knowledge will be further enriched by [Chapter 11](ch11.html#chapter_streams),
    which covers the more advanced streaming interfaces in PHP.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The next three chapters cover critical concepts in web development. [Chapter 12](ch12.html#chapter_errors)
    introduces PHP’s error-handling and exception interfaces. [Chapter 13](ch13.html#chapter_debugging)
    ties errors directly to interactive debugging and unit testing. Finally, [Chapter 14](ch14.html#chapter_performance)
    illustrates how to properly tune a PHP application for speed, scalability, and
    stability.

- en: PHP itself is open source, and much of the core language began life as community
    *extensions* to the system. The next chapter, [Chapter 15](ch15.html#chapter_extensions),
    covers both native extensions to PHP (those written in C and compiled to run alongside
    the language itself) and third-party PHP packages that can extend the functionality
    of your own application. Next, [Chapter 16](ch16.html#chapter_databases) introduces
    both databases and some of the extensions used to manage them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I dedicate [Chapter 17](ch17.html#chapter_asynchronous) to covering both the
    newer threading model introduced in PHP 8.1 as well as asynchronous coding in
    general. Finally, [Chapter 18](ch18.html#chapter_command_line) wraps up this survey
    of PHP by introducing the power of the command line and applications written to
    target commands as an interface.

    Sample code was tested in a containerized Linux environment but should run equally
